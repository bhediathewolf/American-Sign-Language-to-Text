# American-Sign-Language-to-Text
This project in Python levies OpenCV library to detect hand features from webcam input and, predicts the resemblance to any of the signs in the data set. This is an ongoing project.

## Status
Currently, we can recognize features in the real time.

## Next Steps
- Apply the same process on data set of alphabets in sign language
- Use a machine learning algorithm to match realtime footage with the dataset
- This process converts sign to individual characters in the alphabet. It will be better if we can convert it into Proper English sentences since the grammar is different for sign language
